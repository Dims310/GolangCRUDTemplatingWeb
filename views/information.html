        This site works using golang, without extensive knowledge, there are still many design flaws on this site even though it's only CRUD.

        Why create, update, and delete using the POST method? </p>
        <p>
        HTML5 has a policy of using only two methods namely GET and POST, previously it was said that adding PUT and DELETE caused a bug. While PUT and DELETE themselves are usually used for REST systems.
